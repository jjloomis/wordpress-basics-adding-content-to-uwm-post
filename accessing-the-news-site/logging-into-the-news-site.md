# Logging in to UWM Post

To log into a self-hosted WordPress site (like The UWM Post site), go to the site's home page and add `/wp-admin/` to the end of the URL.

## UWM Post

1. Go to the following URL: [http://uwmpost.com/wp-admin/](http://uwmpost.com/wp-admin/)
2. Use your UWM email address in the username field. Use the password you created when you [reset your password](resetting-your-password.md). **Note:** Your password is not synced with your UWM accounts (D2L, PAWS, Outlook 365, etc.) Your username is your UWM email address because it's an easy to remember unique identifier.&#x20;

## Common login problems

* Attempting to log into WordPress.com instead of the news site login screen (see above)
* Attempting to to log into WordPress.org instead of the news site login screen(see above)
