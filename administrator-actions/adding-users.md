# Working with Roles and Adding Users

Before adding a user, you should have a solid understanding of user roles. Assigning the wrong role to a user can put the entire site in jeopardy. For example, a user with an Editor or Administrator role could potentially delete all of a site's content in less than five minutes.

## Working with Roles

Always give a user the lowest level role they need. If you're unsure about what role a user should have, stick with Subscriber or Contributor. You can always give them a higher level role later.

**Media Milwaukee**: Students are only assigned a Subscriber or Contributor role. Never give a student any other role.

**UWM Post**: New writers are only assigned a Subscriber or Contributor role. Don't assign an Author or Editor role to a user until they've proven themselves trustworthy in lower level roles. The Administrator role should be given to as few users as possible.
