## Image is upside down or sideways

If the image is upside down or sideways on social media, it was probably uploaded to WordPress that way and then rotated in the WordPress Edit Media window. This is fine when the the image stays within WordPress, but problems arise when Facebook refrences the original (non-rotated) version of the image.

**Note**: You may run into this problem even if it looks like the image is properly rotated on your computer. Occasionally, different platforms (your phone, WordPress, your computer's operating system, etc.) will disagree on what constitutes "the bottom" of an image.

1. On your computer, use [Adobe Photoshop](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/adobe-photoshop-basics/content/) (or your computer's default photo editing program) to open, rotate, and save a new version of your original image to your computer. **Note**: Even if your image appears properly rotated when you open it this way, use the program to save a new version of the image.
