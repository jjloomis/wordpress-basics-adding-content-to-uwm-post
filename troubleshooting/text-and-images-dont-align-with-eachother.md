# Text and Images are Totally Misaligned

If your text and images are not lining up correctly, you may have added your images while you were still working with your text. (The best approach is to add all your text first and then add your images.)

These instructions will require you to add media (images, MP3s, etc.) to your post again.

1. In the Visual editor, select all of the content in your post. Note: You can click within the editor and press **Command A** (on keyboard) to select everything in the editor.
2. Copy the selected content.
3. With the content selected, press **Delete** (on keyboard) to delete the content of your post.
4. In the Visual editor toolbar, make sure the **Toggle Toolbar** button is selected. (You should see two rows of tools in the toolbar.)
5. Click the **Paste as Text** button in the Visual editor toolbar. **Note**: A warning box may appear. You can close this box.
6. Paste your copied text back into the Visual editor.
7. Add your media back into your post.
8. When finished, click **Submit for Review** or **Publish**.
