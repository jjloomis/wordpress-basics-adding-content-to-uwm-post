# Adding Alt Text to an Image

Every image in a post needs an alt text (alternative text) description. Alt text is necessary for accessibility devices (such as screen readers) and provides Search Engine Optimization (SEO) benefits.&#x20;

1. In a post, click an image.
2. In the **Settings** panel (on right), make sure the **Block** tab is active. In the **Block** tab area, scroll down to the **Image settings** area (click the down arrow to expand this area, if necessary.)&#x20;
3. In the **Alt text** box, add a brief description of the content of the photo.
4. When finished, click **Save Draft**.
