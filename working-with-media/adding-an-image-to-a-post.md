# Adding an Image to a Post

**Note**: Always add all of the text to a post before adding images.

Never attempt to align or reposition an image using the Visual editor toolbar or **Tab**/**spacebar** keys on your keyboard (clicking and dragging the image won't work either.) Always use the image formatting toolbar to wrap text around the image or change its size.

Before uploading an image, give it a relevant name following [JAMS file and folder naming conventions](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/file-and-folder-naming-conventions.html). The name of the image is visible on the internet (in the address bar and in Google Image search results.)

1. In the [Visual editor](../working-with-text-and-links/working-with-content-in-the-visual-editor.md), position the cursor where you would like the image to appear.&#x20;
2. Click the **Add Media** button.
3. In the Insert Media window, make sure the Upload Files tab is selected.
4. On your computer, navigate to and select the image you'd like to add your post. Click and drag the image into the Insert Media window. The image will appear selected in the Media Library.
5. In the lower-right, go to Attachment Display Settings and choose an image size. &#x20;
6. If your image is not a full column-width image, you will need to [wrap your text around the image](wrapping-text-around-an-image.md).
7. When finished, click **Submit for Review** or **Publish**.&#x20;
