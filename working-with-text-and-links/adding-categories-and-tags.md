# Adding Categories and Tags

Categories and tags are taxonomies that organize the content of a site.

Categories are like the table of contents of a book. On the front-end of Media Milwaukee and The UWM Post, categories appear as menu items (News, Opinion, etc.) and widgetized homepage areas (Top Storie, More News, etc.) All posts in Media Milwaukee and The UWM Post must have a category.

Tags are like the index of a book. Tags are less frequently used taxonomies that are not mandatory. Examples might include "State Fair rides 2017" or "Freeway construction."
