# Creating a Post

To add a story to a news site, you'll need to create a post and submit it for review. Your post will not be public until your instructor or editor reviews and approves your content.

1. From the Dashboard, click **Posts** and select **Add New**.&#x20;
2. Enter a title for your post.
3. Use the [Visual editor](working-with-content-in-the-visual-editor.md) to add text and media elements to your post. Use the [Text editor](working-with-content-in-the-text-editor.md) when working with code.
4. Select a category. **Note**: Do not select a home page category (Home - Whatever.) Your instructor or editor will do this.&#x20;
5. Edit your URL, if necessary.&#x20;
6. To preview your post, click **Preview**. **Note**: This will open a new tab in your browser. Be sure to work with the original tab when making changes to your post.
7. When finished, click **Submit for Review** or **Publish**.&#x20;
